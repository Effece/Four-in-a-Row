# Four in a Row
This was my first Java project. It uses Swing and Awt for the graphics.

## Game presentation
Just a simple Four in a Row.
Two players face off, playing one after the other, dropping one token in one column. First to align four tokens of their color wins.

## AI
I tried implementing an AI but wasn't successful. It would either take too long or have mistakes.
